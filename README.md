# project 49
Goal of the Project: In Class 49, you have learnt to add different HTML tags.

Getting Started: 

1. Open the git bash and make a directory using the command “mkdir c49-Project”.

Specific Tasks to complete the Project: 
1. The first line should be <!DOCTYPE html>. 
2. Start with the <html> tags. *All tags have an open and close tag. 
3. Inside the html tag, create a <head> tag.

    ● Add the <title> tag.

9. Use target=”_blank” in an anchor tag to open the link in a new tab. 
10. Use the <img> tag inside the <a> tag to make sure that my images, when clicked, open the link which explains how to do the origami.
    ● The link can be a video or a webpage. 
11. Add text that says interesting facts about the Origami using <p> paragraph tags.
