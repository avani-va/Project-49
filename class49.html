    <h1>Fruits and vegetables</h1>
    <p>
        Fruit and vegetables should be an important part of your daily diet. They are naturally good and contain
        vitamins
        and minerals that can help to keep you healthy. They can also help protect against some diseases.
        Most Australians will benefit from eating more fruit and vegetables as part of a well-balanced, regular diet and
        a healthy, active lifestyle. There are many varieties of fruit and vegetables available and many ways to
        prepare, cook and serve them.
        You should eat at least five serves of vegetables and two serves of fruit each day. Choose different colours and
        varieties.
        A serve of vegetables is about one cup of raw salad vegetables or 1/2 cup of cooked.
        A serve of fruit is about one medium piece, 2 small pieces of 1 cup canned (no added sugar).

        Fruits and vegetables contain many vitamins and minerals that are good for your health. These include vitamins A
        (beta-carotene), C and E, magnesium, zinc, phosphorous and folic acid. Folic acid may reduce blood levels of
        homocysteine, a substance that may be a risk factor for coronary heart disease.
